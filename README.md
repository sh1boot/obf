# obf

Converts plain text into other plain text, and back again.

Needs `dictionary.txt` (a simple list of words like
[this](http://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000) or
[this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-usa.txt),
though a list including contractions would be far more useful here) and
`corpus.txt` (any large volume of English text from which to gather frequency
statistics) to run.
